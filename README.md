# WireGuard Admin App
Turn a Raspberry Pi into a simple WireGuard* VPN Appliance

WGAdmin is a free tool that converts a Raspberry Pi single-board computer into an easy-to-use WireGuard VPN Appliance. WGAdmin allows you to create, configure, and manage a simple WireGuard network without messing around with configuration files.

Architecturally, WGAdmin is a configuration management layer wrapped around the standard WireGuard software. It's the missing WireGuard GUI and config generator. Security and heavy lifting is handled by WireGuard natively.
